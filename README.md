# Netflix-clone
Welcome to my Netflix Clone project! This web application is a static replica of the popular streaming platform, Netflix, created using only HTML and CSS. The primary goal of this project was to practice and demonstrate my skills in front-end web development.

Features:

Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes
Replicated Netflix's user interface including the header, main content area, and footer
Implemented grid and flexbox layouts for a clean and organized structure
Styled various components such as navigation bar, movie posters, and featured content
